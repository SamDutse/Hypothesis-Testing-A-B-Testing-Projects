    "\n",
    "Two candidates, Candidate A and Candidate B, are contesting for a political office. A survey was conducted to determine the proportion of people likely to vote for each candidate. Candidate A's campaign team wants to understand their confidence in winning the election by calculating a **confidence interval** for the proportion of people supporting Candidate A.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Plan**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Obtain survey results (sample size \\( n \\)) and the proportion of voters supporting Candidate A (\\( p \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formulate the Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "   - Use the formula for the confidence interval of a population proportion:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Confidence Interval} = p \\pm Z \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - \\( Z \\): The Z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Steps to Calculate**:\n",
    "   1. Compute the sample proportion \\( p \\) (e.g., percentage of people supporting Candidate A from the survey).\n",
    "   2. Determine the standard error using \\( SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\).\n",
    "   3. Calculate the margin of error: \\( \\text{Margin of Error} = Z \\cdot SE \\).\n",
    "   4. Compute the confidence interval bounds:\n",
    "      \\[\n",
    "      [p - \\text{Margin of Error}, p + \\text{Margin of Error}]\n",
    "      \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision**:\n",
    "   - Use the confidence interval to determine the range of support Candidate A likely has in the population.\n",
